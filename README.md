# venturi

Venturi is a client application for streaming realtime data from the WI daq modules using TCP connections. 

This application is using the WI-Oak library to build the GUI using GLFW, Vulkan, ImGui and ImPlot. 
Oak handles all the backend stuff like creating windows, imgui panels, handling events, etc. 

[insert name] handles all the client-server communication to control and stream data from the daq. 

the venturi app simply defines the UI elements. 

this is very much a work in progress.
